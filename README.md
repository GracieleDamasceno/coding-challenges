#Gracie's Coding Challenges!
<hr>
Coding is just like to ride a bike: you never forget, and sometimes the bike is on fire going down a hill ultra-fast without breaks, just to hit a pit of angry and deadly wasps that were minding their own business.

So I find important to warm-up the brain with some fun - or not so much - coding challenges. Solving them makes you feel good, like you are capable of recreating the whole world in a silly Java program - just to notice that the result will not compile because you forgot a semicolon. Oh well.
